                <p> Setting up Git: <br>
                    I already had Git installed and set up on my computer from last year as I used it in
                    group work and so I have some experience with it and know how to use it in terms of collaborations but
                    have yet to explore its other features.
                    <br><br>

                    The Library of Babel is very interesting and has many similarities to the internet like its possession
                    of limitless information (you just have to know where and how to find it). The chaotic organisation of
                    the library is similar to the internet which is often seen as a chaotic and disorganised space where it
                    can be difficult to find relevant information at times amidst the clutter of countless websites and
                    pages. The redundancy of the library as it contains countless copies of the same books is similar to how
                    the internet contains endless websites and articles covering the same topics. The librarians of the
                    library are in a way holding a position of power as they are the gatekeepers of knowledge similar to the
                    way search engines, social media platforms and governments can be seen as gatekeepers of information as
                    they can through their algorithms and authority can suppress or boost information and narratives which
                    shape and control information available to users which has effects upon the real world as people's
                    ability to form their own opinions are removed without them even knowing.
                    <br><br>

                    My goal for this course is to learn new coding languages and utilise them to create websites built upon
                    a solid foundation through the application of the theory we will learn this year.

                <p> My experience starting with HTML: <br>
                    I was very excited to begin learning HTML as not only will it expand my knowledge of coding languages but it
                    is the foundation of the web and is essential for web development. I realised that HTML is more powerful
                    than I imagined. I learned how to create headings, paragraphs, lists and links even adding images to my web
                    page. It was very fun and interesting experimenting with various HTML tags and seeing the effect they have
                    on the layout and design of my page.

                    Reflection on the reading: <br>
                    In Lawson, Bruce. “Why You Should Choose HTML5” Lawson makes some very interesting points throughout the
                    reading. Lawson focuses on the difference between the 'article' and 'section' elements in HTML5 and
                    gives
                    tips on how to make use of them appropriately. The article was well written and provides examples to
                    help understand the content. I found it very interesting and useful as a beginner in HTML as it will
                    help me understand how to create more user-friendly web pages in the future.

                    Reflection on internet histories:<br>
                    This week we delved into the internet’s history which offered a fascinating glimpse into the
                    evolution of the internet and the technology that surrounds it as well as its impact upon society.
                    Learning about the internet’s history helps me to understand the key technological and social
                    elements that have formed the internet as it is today. It provides valuable insight into the
                    challenges that will emerge as we traverse this complex and ever changing, ever evolving digital
                    ecosystem. By studying the past we can be better informed and prepared for the challenges and
                    opportunities that lay ahead of us.

                <p>My experience learning CSS and continuing the development of your website: <br>
                    This week we started to learn CSS and how it works with HTML inorder to give a website some more style and personality.
                    I enjoyed learning about the different ways CSS can integrate with HTML, especially the way in which you can have a separate CSS script for styling the website
                    as a whole. This method seems to be the easiest and cleanest way to go about integrating CSS into my website as instead of individually editing lines in 
                    my HTML files I can rather have the CSS styling applied throughout my entire website.With this new found knowledge I started working on integrating CSS 
                    into my website and experimenting with it. I focused primarily upon my home page as its style will be the template I will use to build the other pages 
                    within my website. I feel that I have grasped the concept of CSS and how to incorporate it into my website however I did struggle at first with it. I now 
                    am confident in my ability to make use of it. <br><br>
                    
                    Reflection on this week's reading: <br>
                    Mailloux's article “Convention and Context”, emphasises the importance of considering the context in which the convention is being used as a design convention
                    that works well in one context may not be appropriate in another. The reading has taught me that understanding conventions and context is crucial in designing
                    user-centred digital products that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. By being mindful of the conventions that users expect and the context in 
                    which they will use the product, it can help me to create digital experiences that are intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable to use.<br><br>
                    
                    My perspective on the supplementary material: <br>
                    I find that the supplementary material is extremely valuable to me as at times I can feel lost or struggle to grasp concepts discussed in our lectures and so 
                    I turn to the supplementary material to assist me in understanding these concepts. So far I have found this to be beneficial for me as it provides me with clarity
                    as I am able to sit and reflect on the lectures with the assistance of the supplementary material. This is especially useful when it comes to the technical side
                    of Interactive Media where we are learning new concepts every week.

                <p>My Experience continuing the development of my website:<br>
                    As I have been building my website's blog page I have encountered both success and challenges. While I have put in a lot of effort to create an engaging 
                    platform I have also faced difficulties in formatting the page and making it aesthetically pleasing. One of the primary challenges I faced was finding the
                    right balance between readability and attractiveness. I experimented with different layouts, colour schemes, and typography to create a visually engaging 
                    design that would not compromise the readability of my blog posts. Another challenge I encountered was organising my blog posts in a way that would make them
                     easy to navigate. Despite the challenges I am happy with the progress I have made in building my website's blog page. I have learned a lot about web design 
                     and user experience, and I am looking forward to continuing to improve my platform in the future. By creating an aesthetically pleasing and well-organised 
                     blog page I hope to provide a great user experience and create a platform that is engaging.

                    How do my wireframes hold up against the readings and lectures on UI?<br>
                    After going through this week's reading I took a look at my wireframes for my website and realised that some changes needed to be made. The concepts discussed
                    in the reading showed me the areas where my wireframes fell short. I made changes to my wireframes to ensure that the most important elements of my website 
                    stood out and that there was consistency in the design across all pages. I also simplified the layout and removed any unnecessary elements to enhance the user
                    experience as after all I seek to create a minimalist yet aesthetically pleasing and engaging experience.<br><br>
                    
                    Reflection on this week's readings:<br>
                    In this week's reading "The Basic Principles of User Interface Design" I learnt about what makes a successful website through the use of good UI practice.
                    The reading was very eye opening as it provided me with good and easy to understand explanations on consistency, context and the functionality of UI. 
                    I intend to attempt to utilise the ideas discussed in this reading in my process of further developing my website.

                    My experience continuing the development of my website:<br>
                    This week I mostly worked on enhancing the user experience of my website by putting my finishing touches on the UI. in particular I have concentrated on polishing my portfolio and design pages. I also focused on fine tuning my wireframes and producing detailed design sketches that capture the full extent of my vision for the website.

                    My IxD Process during the development of my website: <br>
                    My Goal:
                    I want my website to impress users with its clean, elegant design and effectively communicate my skills as a web designer. I want users to be inspired by my work and motivated to contact me for design services or exploring more of my portfolio.

                    Information structure:<br>
                    The website features a navigation bar at the top of each page for easy access. The home page introduces the creator and website. The blog page has a selection of blogs with a fixed navigation bar on the right for easy access, which remains visible while scrolling down the page. The design page displays a document in the centre left, detailing the website's design, with a similar navigation bar on the right. The profile page features a picture of the creator and information about their skills and interests, with a link to their portfolio page. The portfolio page has a similar layout to the design page, with a navigation bar on the right for easy navigation.
                    <br><br>
                    User Flow:<br>
                    The website's home page is the starting point, with a top navigation bar to move to other pages. Blog, design, and portfolio pages have a similar layout, with a fixed navigation bar on the right side for easy access to specific sections. Users can scroll down to read more information on these pages. The profile page also has a scrollable layout and a button to access the portfolio page.

                    Reflection on this week's reading: <br>
                    I found Hassenzahl and Tractinsky's paper "User Experience - A Research Agenda" to be a very insightful paper which focuses on the user experience. Hassenzahl and Tractinsky’s aim is to understand and improve user experience, emphasising the importance of understanding user needs, emotions, and behaviours. From the paper I have learnt the importance of considering the entire user experience, rather than just individual components. This means that as a website developer, I need to think about the user's experience from the moment they land on the website to the moment they leave. In developing my website I intend to keep the principles outlined in this paper in mind as they could be incredibly helpful and I can create a website that not only meets functional requirements but also provides a positive user experience. By considering the user's needs and emotions I can create a website that is not only functional but also enjoyable to use.

                <h1>Week 8</h1>

                <p>
                    What went wrong?<br>
                    One area where I encountered difficulty was in the alignment of certain sections on the site, which would become misaligned when viewed on different screen sizes. This was frustrating, as I had put a lot of effort into designing each section to look just right, only to have it fall apart when viewed on certain devices. <br><br>

                    What went right? <br>
                    I feel that my website overall was successful in achieving the aesthetic and layout that I had envisioned. I put a lot of thought into the colour scheme, font choices, and overall organisation of the site, and I'm proud of how it turned out. <br><br>

                    Where did I struggle? <br>
                    One of the areas where I struggled the most during development was with CSS formatting. Getting sections to appear alongside each other and maintaining consistency across different pages was a challenge, and I spent a lot of time tinkering with the code to get everything just right. While I did eventually overcome these difficulties, I recognize that I could have saved myself a lot of time and frustration by seeking out more resources and guidance on CSS formatting earlier in the process. <br> <br>

                    What would you do differently? <br>
                    One thing I would definitely do differently is to rework the semantic markup of my site. While the overall layout and aesthetic of the site were successful, I know that there are improvements that can be made in terms of the underlying HTML structure. By focusing on improving the semantic structure of the site, I believe that I can not only improve its accessibility and search engine optimization, but also make it easier to maintain and update in the future. <br><br>

                    Reflection on Graham et al. - 2015 - Towards a study of information geographies: <br>
                    I found this reading to be very interesting and raises important questions about the distribution of internet access around the world as it highlights the divide between the global south and the north. This uneven distribution of internet access and information flows is shaped by a complex interplay of historical, political, economic, and cultural factors. <br> <br>

                    Reflection on the Digital Hegemonies reading: <br>
                    Ballatore's 2017 paper on "Digital Hegemonies" provides a critical perspective on the global dominance of search engines and their impact on local communities. Ballatore argues that despite the global reach of search engines, their algorithms are shaped by local factors such as language, culture, and geography, leading to the formation of digital hegemonies that privilege certain regions and communities over others, namely the global north. This paper ties to the previous reading on Information geographies as it highlights the uneven distribution of digital resources and power. Both papers emphasise the importance of studying the spatial dimensions of digital inequality and the need for more nuanced approaches to understanding the complex ways in which technology and geography interact. <br> <br>

                    Reflection on the reading 'Digital inequalities in the age of artificial intelligence and big data' by Lutz(2019): <br>
                    Lutz's 2019 paper on digital inequalities provides a review of the relationship between digital inequalities and its context in the world. Lutz emphasises the need for research to focus more on labour and big data-related questions, with a focus on the negative impacts that algorithmic decision making can have upon vulnerable population groups. Lutz highlights three main levels of digital divides which can be used to better understand digital iniquities. The author discusses access to digital technologies, digital skills and technology use, and outcomes of digital technology use, highlighting the need to integrate literature more strongly with critical algorithm studies and discussions on datafication, digital footprints, and information privacy. This reading serves as an important reminder of the continued existence of digital inequalities in an age of artificial intelligence and big data. Lutz calls for further research to address these issues and highlights the potential negative consequences of algorithmic decision-making for marginalised groups. It is a valuable contribution to the ongoing discourse on digital inequalities and their implications for society.  <br> <br>

                    Development of my website: <br>
                    Learning to add JavaScript to my website has been both exciting and challenging. One of the difficulties I've encountered is getting my code to work as intended. Unlike HTML and CSS, which are forgiving and allow for some errors, JavaScript requires precise syntax and logical flow leaving no room for mistakes and feels more similar to other languages I know like C#. I also noticed how JavaScript can simplify and streamline certain aspects of my website. By utilising JavaScript, I can enhance my users' experience and make my site more engaging and easier to work with. Learning to implement JavaScript into my website is a valuable skill to have as a web developer. It has taken me a lot of time and effort as I am still new to this language but the payoff when it works is worthwhile. I'll continue learning and experimenting with JavaScript, and soon I'll be able to create dynamic and interactive web experiences with ease. <br> <br>

                    My experience continuing the development of my website: <br>
                    This week I started working on further refining my website. I made sure the navigation bar at the top of every page remains visible at all times. This adjustment allows users to access it effortlessly allowing for seamless navigation throughout the site. I also began working on some subtle animations for buttons and text when the user hovers over them to provide feedback to the user and make the site feel more alive, enhancing the overall experience of my website. <br> <br>
                    
                    Reflection on “The Road to Technocolonialism”: <br>
                    I found “The Road to Technocolonialism” to be very interesting as it raises significant concerns on the dominance of AI development being held by the US and China and how this situation could lead to a new form of colonialism where the global south is dependent on nations like the US for access to AI technology. Developing countries, lacking the infrastructure to develop their own AI systems, are likely to enter into agreements with the AI superpowers, trading access to technology for economic aid and political gains. This can lead to a situation where the US and China can use this as a tool to exert political and economic power onto developing nations. This is a terrifying possibility as these AI client states will be at the full mercy of these superpowers especially as technology progresses and AI technology becomes more prevalent in society. These superpowers could potentially cripple a nation by cutting off their access to essential technologies required in the modern era. This centralised control and ownership of technology by the AI superpowers will lead to a form of domination and the erosion of local autonomy. There is undoubtedly a need to address emerging technocolonialism. If left unchecked, developing nations will be faced with a choice between becoming a techno colony or a “New Dark Age" (Verdi, 2020). <br> <br>

                    This week I worked on more animations on each page of my website which creates a seamless and smooth experience for the user. I am satisfied with how it turned out as it greatly improved the overall aesthetic and feel of the website in my opinion. I also began to develop a sorting button to my blog page. This button will allow the user to sort the blogs in ascending or descending order utilising JavaScript. The system is somewhat working but there is still some polishing I need to do at this point. <br> <br>

                    When thinking about how our code matters in digital-colonialisms, can you identify any things in your own coding practice that you should be aware of?: <br>
                    When I think about how my code relates to digital colonialism, there are important considerations to keep in mind. Firstly, I need to be aware that my code can either reinforce or challenge existing power imbalances and inequalities. Digital colonialism, like I discussed in last week's blog, refers to the unequal distribution of power and exploitation in the digital world where certain big nations like the US and China dominate information and technology. So, I should consider how my code might unintentionally contribute to these disparities. This week's lecture has raised some interesting questions on this topic and how as developers it is important to be conscientious of this and make an effort to change inorder to promote a more inclusive environment. By being mindful of the implications of our code in the context of digital colonialism, promoting inclusivity and accessibility, we can contribute to a more equitable and friendly digital landscape. <br> <br>

                    This week I put the finishing touches on my blog sorter. I am satisfied with it as the button,which is a simple grey arrow, fits well with the minimalistic aesthetic of my website. I also began working on my portfolio page where I am excited to display three of the games I made in Game Design this semester. However, this process has been difficult as I have never worked with Unity WebGL builds before and I have had to do much research into how to implement the games on my website. Finally, I added my essay section to my website which includes my essay from Assignment 2.  <br> <br>

                    Reflection on "Traveling While Trans" from Costanza-Chock, S. (2020) Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need. Cambridge, MA, USA: MIT Press (Information Policy): <br>
                    I found that the reading "Traveling While Trans" from Costanza-Chock's "Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need" raised important issues faced by members of the trans community and other marginalised groups. The reading has shown me  the potential of design and the responsibility we have as designers to challenge existing power structures and create inclusive spaces.

                    As a student studying Interactive Media who wishes to work in the respective industry, I have the unique opportunity to shape user experiences and influence how people interact with digital platforms. This comes with much responsibility as Costanza-Chock highlights the importance of considering the diverse needs and experiences of marginalised groups with a particular focus on transgender individuals in our design process.
                    
                    While it is unlikely that designers are intentionally trying to discriminate against marginalised groups their products may. By doing so designers dehumanise and devalidate transgender individuals' identities. This is why designing with a focus on inclusivity is important as it will acknowledge and address the specific challenges faced by transgender people and actively involve and centre the voices of the communities we aim to serve, ensuring that their needs and perspectives are heard and respected.
                    
                    The reading has shown me that there is a need for my designs to support and advocate for social justice, actively contributing to a more equitable society. It reminds me to approach my work with humility, empathy, and a commitment to challenging oppressive systems. <br> <br>

                    This week I implemented a smooth scroller function for the side navigation bar using JavaScript. Now when a user clicks on one of the sections in the side navigation bar, instead of jumping straight to the section the page will seamlessly scroll to the section. I also polished some parts of my website like the blogs and design page where I made the border thinner as well as added a subtle shadow to make them more visually appealing. <br> <br>
                    
                    Reflection on Digital Inclusion: <br>
                    The reading highlights the crucial issue of digital inclusion and digital exclusion in the increasingly digitised modern world. It raises the importance of equal access to information and communication technologies for individuals and groups and the lack of this in the 21st century. Africa is lagging behind the rest of the world in terms of internet access with only 39.3% of inhabitants having access to the internet. This is in contrast to America's 94.6% which clearly shows a digital divide between the continents and highlights the need for digital inclusion. The article also brings some light on how rural areas have much to offer in terms of uniqueness and diversity to the online market. However, the lack of access to the internet creates a barrier, preventing the recognition and appreciation of rural cultures. Digital inclusion should be a priority for all designers as only by promoting universal access and digital literacy can we create a more inclusive and equitable digital society.  <br> <br>

                    Reflection on Tataki and Glynos - 2020 - Digital Divide Widens: <br>
                    This reading highlights how the current digital divide has only been widened by the COVID-19 pandemic. This digital divide disproportionately affects vulnerable groups like students from low-income families as well as ethnic minorities.This divide was made larger through the transition to remote work as it is primarily available to high income individuals in occupations that do not require physical interaction. This leaves less privileged workers, who are more likely to face job insecurity, at a disadvantage. The economic challenges resulting from the pandemic also threaten jobs in low-paying sectors that require physical interaction with customers or close proximity to others. Tataki and Glynos(2020) do mention some short term solutions that have been implemented such as the UK government providing students with laptops however they also recognise that there is a need for more long-term solutions to close the digital divide and bring about equal access to digital infrastructure world wide. If we don’t address the digital divide soon we will see a world of increasing inequality where vulnerable groups are unable to fully access and utilise the internet putting them at a greater disadvantage to the upper classes. In the modern era, we should recognise the importance of internet access as a basic need as I believe that this will help us to work towards closing the digital divide and create a more inclusive society. <br> <br>
