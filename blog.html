                <p> Setting up Git: <br>
                    I already had Git installed and set up on my computer from last year as I used it in
                    group work and so I have some experience with it and know how to use it in terms of collaborations but
                    have yet to explore its other features.
                    <br><br>

                    The Library of Babel is very interesting and has many similarities to the internet like its possession
                    of limitless information (you just have to know where and how to find it). The chaotic organisation of
                    the library is similar to the internet which is often seen as a chaotic and disorganised space where it
                    can be difficult to find relevant information at times amidst the clutter of countless websites and
                    pages. The redundancy of the library as it contains countless copies of the same books is similar to how
                    the internet contains endless websites and articles covering the same topics. The librarians of the
                    library are in a way holding a position of power as they are the gatekeepers of knowledge similar to the
                    way search engines, social media platforms and governments can be seen as gatekeepers of information as
                    they can through their algorithms and authority can suppress or boost information and narratives which
                    shape and control information available to users which has effects upon the real world as people's
                    ability to form their own opinions are removed without them even knowing.

                    My goal for this course is to learn new coding languages and utilise them to create websites built upon
                    a solid foundation through the application of the theory we will learn this year.

                <p> My experience starting with HTML: <br>
                    I was very excited to begin learning HTML as not only will it expand my knowledge of coding languages but it
                    is the foundation of the web and is essential for web development. I realised that HTML is more powerful
                    than I imagined. I learned how to create headings, paragraphs, lists and links even adding images to my web
                    page. It was very fun and interesting experimenting with various HTML tags and seeing the effect they have
                    on the layout and design of my page.

                    Reflection on the reading: <br>
                    In Lawson, Bruce. “Why You Should Choose HTML5” Lawson makes some very interesting points throughout the
                    reading. Lawson focuses on the difference between the 'article' and 'section' elements in HTML5 and
                    gives
                    tips on how to make use of them appropriately. The article was well written and provides examples to
                    help understand the content. I found it very interesting and useful as a beginner in HTML as it will
                    help me understand how to create more user-friendly web pages in the future.

                    Reflection on internet histories:<br>
                    This week we delved into the internet’s history which offered a fascinating glimpse into the
                    evolution of the internet and the technology that surrounds it as well as its impact upon society.
                    Learning about the internet’s history helps me to understand the key technological and social
                    elements that have formed the internet as it is today. It provides valuable insight into the
                    challenges that will emerge as we traverse this complex and ever changing, ever evolving digital
                    ecosystem. By studying the past we can be better informed and prepared for the challenges and
                    opportunities that lay ahead of us.

                <p>My experience learning CSS and continuing the development of your website: <br>
                    This week we started to learn CSS and how it works with HTML inorder to give a website some more style and personality.
                    I enjoyed learning about the different ways CSS can integrate with HTML, especially the way in which you can have a separate CSS script for styling the website
                    as a whole. This method seems to be the easiest and cleanest way to go about integrating CSS into my website as instead of individually editing lines in 
                    my HTML files I can rather have the CSS styling applied throughout my entire website.With this new found knowledge I started working on integrating CSS 
                    into my website and experimenting with it. I focused primarily upon my home page as its style will be the template I will use to build the other pages 
                    within my website. I feel that I have grasped the concept of CSS and how to incorporate it into my website however I did struggle at first with it. I now 
                    am confident in my ability to make use of it. <br><br>
                    
                    Reflection on this week's reading: <br>
                    Mailloux's article “Convention and Context”, emphasises the importance of considering the context in which the convention is being used as a design convention
                    that works well in one context may not be appropriate in another. The reading has taught me that understanding conventions and context is crucial in designing
                    user-centred digital products that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. By being mindful of the conventions that users expect and the context in 
                    which they will use the product, it can help me to create digital experiences that are intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable to use.<br><br>
                    
                    My perspective on the supplementary material: <br>
                    I find that the supplementary material is extremely valuable to me as at times I can feel lost or struggle to grasp concepts discussed in our lectures and so 
                    I turn to the supplementary material to assist me in understanding these concepts. So far I have found this to be beneficial for me as it provides me with clarity
                    as I am able to sit and reflect on the lectures with the assistance of the supplementary material. This is especially useful when it comes to the technical side
                    of Interactive Media where we are learning new concepts every week.

                <p>My Experience continuing the development of my website:<br>
                    As I have been building my website's blog page I have encountered both success and challenges. While I have put in a lot of effort to create an engaging 
                    platform I have also faced difficulties in formatting the page and making it aesthetically pleasing. One of the primary challenges I faced was finding the
                    right balance between readability and attractiveness. I experimented with different layouts, colour schemes, and typography to create a visually engaging 
                    design that would not compromise the readability of my blog posts. Another challenge I encountered was organising my blog posts in a way that would make them
                     easy to navigate. Despite the challenges I am happy with the progress I have made in building my website's blog page. I have learned a lot about web design 
                     and user experience, and I am looking forward to continuing to improve my platform in the future. By creating an aesthetically pleasing and well-organised 
                     blog page I hope to provide a great user experience and create a platform that is engaging.

                    How do my wireframes hold up against the readings and lectures on UI?<br>
                    After going through this week's reading I took a look at my wireframes for my website and realised that some changes needed to be made. The concepts discussed
                    in the reading showed me the areas where my wireframes fell short. I made changes to my wireframes to ensure that the most important elements of my website 
                    stood out and that there was consistency in the design across all pages. I also simplified the layout and removed any unnecessary elements to enhance the user
                    experience as after all I seek to create a minimalist yet aesthetically pleasing and engaging experience.<br><br>
                    
                    Reflection on this week's readings:<br>
                    In this week's reading "The Basic Principles of User Interface Design" I learnt about what makes a successful website through the use of good UI practice.
                    The reading was very eye opening as it provided me with good and easy to understand explanations on consistency, context and the functionality of UI. 
                    I intend to attempt to utilise the ideas discussed in this reading in my process of further developing my website.

                    My experience continuing the development of my website:<br>
                    This week I mostly worked on enhancing the user experience of my website by putting my finishing touches on the UI. in particular I have concentrated on polishing my portfolio and design pages. I also focused on fine tuning my wireframes and producing detailed design sketches that capture the full extent of my vision for the website.
                    <br><br>
                    My IxD Process during the development of my website: <br>
                    My Goal:
                    I want my website to impress users with its clean, elegant design and effectively communicate my skills as a web designer. I want users to be inspired by my work and motivated to contact me for design services or exploring more of my portfolio.
                    <br><br>
                    Information structure:<br>
                    The website features a navigation bar at the top of each page for easy access. The home page introduces the creator and website. The blog page has a selection of blogs with a fixed navigation bar on the right for easy access, which remains visible while scrolling down the page. The design page displays a document in the centre left, detailing the website's design, with a similar navigation bar on the right. The profile page features a picture of the creator and information about their skills and interests, with a link to their portfolio page. The portfolio page has a similar layout to the design page, with a navigation bar on the right for easy navigation.
                    <br><br>
                    User Flow:<br>
                    The website's home page is the starting point, with a top navigation bar to move to other pages. Blog, design, and portfolio pages have a similar layout, with a fixed navigation bar on the right side for easy access to specific sections. Users can scroll down to read more information on these pages. The profile page also has a scrollable layout and a button to access the portfolio page.

                    Reflection on this week's reading: <br>
                    I found Hassenzahl and Tractinsky's paper "User Experience - A Research Agenda" to be a very insightful paper which focuses on the user experience. Hassenzahl and Tractinsky’s aim is to understand and improve user experience, emphasising the importance of understanding user needs, emotions, and behaviours. From the paper I have learnt the importance of considering the entire user experience, rather than just individual components. This means that as a website developer, I need to think about the user's experience from the moment they land on the website to the moment they leave. In developing my website I intend to keep the principles outlined in this paper in mind as they could be incredibly helpful and I can create a website that not only meets functional requirements but also provides a positive user experience. By considering the user's needs and emotions I can create a website that is not only functional but also enjoyable to use.
