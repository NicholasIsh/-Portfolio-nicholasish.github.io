                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my portfolio! While this website primarily showcases my work in Interactive Media, I have chosen to devote this space to highlight my work in my other major Game Design. Within this portfolio, you will find a collection of projects I have worked on during the semester.

                    Here I present three distinct games that I have crafted with great enthusiasm and dedication. The first is a thrilling 2D shooter, designed to immerse players in an action-packed experience filled with intense battles and strategic manoeuvres. Next, an addictive clicker game, where every click counts and unlocks new levels of progression. Finally, I showcase a turn-based RPG, inviting players to embark on a short journey through an apocalyptic wasteland.
                    
                    Through my portfolio, I aim to demonstrate my expertise in game design, showcasing my ability to create engaging gameplay mechanics, captivating narratives, and visually stunning experiences. I invite you to delve into each project and witness the culmination of my creative vision and technical skills.

                <h2 id="Shooter">2D Shooter</h2>
                <p>This game is top-down shooter with progressive difficulty, diverse weaponry, and strategic gameplay elements. Inspired by influential games like "Enter the Gungeon" and "Nuclear Throne," players will navigate levels, shooting enemies and collecting dropped weapons. The game features a variety of weapons with unique characteristics, ammo pickups to replenish ammunition and bandages for health restoration. Each level introduces new enemy types, challenging players as they progress. </p>

                  <p>I recommend to play the game in fullscreen to ensure it works as intended.</p>

                <h2 id="AsteroidClicker">Asteroid Clicker</h2>
                <p>My Asteroid Clicker game is an addictive and engaging idle game that challenges players to mine asteroids and accumulate valuable resources. In my clicker game, players start with a basic mining setup and must click on asteroids to earn minerals. As they progress, they can purchase mining operations and upgrades to automate the mining process, increasing efficiency and mineral gain. With each new contract achieved by accumulating a large amount of minerals, players unlock new goals and bonuses. Balancing progression and challenge, my clicker game offers a compelling gameplay loop, capturing the addictive nature of clicker games while delivering a unique and exciting experience in the world of asteroid mining.</p>

                <h2 id="TurnBasedRPG">Turn Based RPG</h2>
                <p>In this 2D turn-based RPG set in a post-apocalyptic world devastated by nuclear war, you take on the role of a lone survivor. Waking up in a building after seeking shelter, you encounter a mutant and engage in a fight. As you explore the wasteland, you meet a scientist who needs your help to collect a rare ingredient for a radiation sickness cure. Embark on a dangerous mission, battling mutated creatures and raiders along the way. Through meaningful interactions with characters and decision-making, shape the narrative and your character's development. Collect better equipment, explore a small open world map, and face any challenges that come your way. Will you bring hope back to humanity or choose a different path?</p>
