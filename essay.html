                <h3>Nicholas Isherwood <br>2465008 <br>Interactive Media Essay <br> WSOA3028A</h3>
                
                <p id="introduction">Afrihost is a South African telecommunications and internet service provider that offers a range of internet-related services to individuals and businesses. Afrihost provides various services, including fixed broadband, mobile data, web hosting, and cloud services, to customers across the country. The company's mission is to provide high-speed internet services to its customers while offering excellent customer support. Afrihost has become a trusted provider of internet-related services in South Africa. Afrihost's website is designed to provide customers with an easy and seamless experience when it comes to accessing their internet-related services. The website has a simple layout that allows customers to navigate easily to the various services they require. On the website, customers can sign up for services such as fixed broadband, mobile data, web hosting, and cloud services, as well as manage their accounts, view their usage statistics and make payments. Customers can also access Afrihost's support section, where they can find answers to frequently asked questions and get in touch with the company's customer support team. But is Afrihost’s website an intuitive and user friendly design? Through an analysis of its UI and UX elements we can determine whether it successfully provides an easy experience for customers to manage their internet-related services.
                </p>

                <p id="anaylsis">Afrihost's homepage is designed to provide customers with a clear overview of the company's internet-related services, while also guiding them to the appropriate section of the website for their needs. The homepage is divided into four sections, each with its own distinct purpose and design. At the top of the page, customers are greeted with the Afrihost logo and two navigation bars that allows them to easily access the various sections of the website, such as a help page, view the network status, a search bar and the client zone for customers. The second navigation bar is inline with the afrihost logo and allows customers access to other sections of the website and services Afrihost offers relating to fibre, wireless internet, DLS, mobile, VoIP, Hosting, domains and more information on the company. Beneath the navigation bar, the homepage features a large banner that displays the latest promotions and offers available from Afrihost. This banner is designed to catch the customer's attention and draw them in to explore the company's services further. Below the banner, the homepage is divided into four sections that highlight Afrihost's core internet-related services. 
                </p>

                <p>Each section features a title, short description as well as images and icons that represent the service and buttons that link to more information. This first section gives a brief introduction to afrihost and the services they provide as well as four buttons used to link the user to more information relating to why customers should choose Afrihost, their double-money-back guarantee, testimonials, and their network. The second section gives the user an intractable list showing off the awards Afrihost has won since 2017 building additional credibility with customers. The third section provides the customer with links to articles published by afrihost to further provide customers with information and support. The last section highlights Afrihost's commitment to customer service featuring testimonials from satisfied customers. The structure of Afrihost's homepage is designed to provide customers with a clear overview of the company's internet-related services, while also guiding them to the appropriate section of the website for their needs. The use of images and clear descriptions makes it easy for customers to understand the benefits of each service, while the navigation bar and links to more information make it easy to explore further.</p>

                <p>When designing the website, Afrihost kept the basic principles of user interface design in mind in order to ensure a streamlined and user friendly experience. “The main purpose of user interfaces is that they should match and satisfy the skills and expectations of its users. A system will always be judged by its users not by its functionality, but by its interface design” (Guntupalli, 2008). In terms of readability and legibility the text on Afrihost's homepage is easy to read thanks to the use of a simple, sans-serif font and high contrast between the text and the background. The text is also well-spaced, with enough whitespace to make it easy to read and digest. The visual weight on Afrihost's homepage is well balanced, with each section having a similar weight. The use of icons for each section helps to give them equal prominence, while the text is kept small and unobtrusive. The composition of Afrihost's homepage is simple and clean, with each section clearly defined and easily distinguishable due to the background of each section being either white or grey to indicate the beginning and end of each section. The website makes use of symmetrical balance by utilising evenly spaced sections and the centre alignment of each section's content which creates a sense of balance and symmetry that helps to guide the user's eye through the page.
                </p>

                <p>The use of hierarchy on Afrihost's homepage is clear, with the most important information at the top of the page and the less important information towards the bottom. The use of icons and bold headings helps to draw the user's attention to the key sections of the homepage. The user can easily scan for information about products and services on offer. The emphasis on Afrihost's homepage is on the company's internet-related services, with each section given equal prominence. However, the banner at the top of the page featuring the latest promotions and offers is given slightly more emphasis through the use of bright colours like red, blue and purple and geometric shapes which helps to draw the user's attention to this important information. The headings of each section make use of blue to make it more distinct whilst less important text is grey. The proportion of the different elements on Afrihost's homepage is well-balanced, with each section given enough space to breathe as it makes use of much white space on the sides of the information. The use of equally sized icons and headings also helps to give each section similar importance. The overall harmony of Afrihost's homepage is good, with each section blending seamlessly into the next. The use of a consistent colour scheme and font also helps to give the homepage a cohesive and unified look.
                </p>

                <p id="ux">UX is focused on the user’s journey to solve a problem and in the case of an Afrihost user they will visit the website in search of a credible Internet service provider. The UX of Afrihost's website is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for the user, by ensuring that the website is easy to navigate and the information is presented in a clear and understandable way. "UX design focuses on creating effective, efficient, and enjoyable interactions between users and products or services. In website design, UX aims to provide a seamless and intuitive user journey, with UI design playing a critical role in supporting the overall user experience” (Hassenzahl, 2018). One of the key features of the UX on Afrihost's website is the ease of navigation. The website is structured in a logical and intuitive way, with the navigation bar located at the top of the page and clearly labelled links that take the user to the appropriate section of the website. The navigation bar is designed to be prominent and easy to find, with a contrasting colour and bold font that helps to draw the user's attention. The links are also clearly labelled, with descriptive text that makes it easy for the user to understand what each section of the website contains.
                </p>

                <p>The website uses simple and concise language that is easy to understand, even for users who may not be familiar with technical terminology. This helps to make the website more accessible and user-friendly, by reducing the cognitive load on the user and making it easier for them to find the information they need as Vistisen and Jensen argue, "the need for clear communication and transparency is evident in the design process" (Vistisen & Jensen, 2017). The UX also makes use of a range of visual cues and feedback mechanisms to guide the user and provide them with information. When the user hovers their mouse over a link in the navigation bar, the link changes colour to provide visual feedback that they have successfully activated the link. The use of icons and images also helps to make the website more visually appealing and engaging, while also providing the user with additional information about the content of each section. The use of whitespace, colour, and typography all play a role in creating a cohesive and effective UI that ties into the UX as Shneiderman states, "strive for consistency" (Shneiderman, 1986). 
                </p>

                <p id="ethical">One of the most significant ethical concerns is the potential for influencing user behaviour. As UX professionals recognize, design has the power to subconsciously influence and alter behaviour. Afrihost's website utilises persuasive design techniques to encourage users to take specific actions, such as signing up for a service. While this may seem harmless, there is always the risk that such design techniques may be used to nudge users toward ends that are not in their best interest, such as signing up for a more expensive plan. Peta Goldberg emphasises that “such constant monitoring of the individual can also have the opposite effect, instead leaving one feeling the loss of highly valued privacy and dignity because of non-stop monitoring” (Goldberg, 2021). There is also a concern regarding the erosion of privacy on the website. While the website offers many benefits, such as easy access to information and services, it may also collect and store user data, raising concerns about how that data will be used and protected. This constant monitoring of users' online behaviour can also lead to feelings of loss of privacy and dignity.
                </p>

                <p>Afrihost's potential use of dark UX patterns is a significant concern. These design elements subtly push users in a certain direction, potentially trapping them into taking actions they didn't intend to. While Afrihost's website doesn't appear to use such patterns, it's important to recognize the potential for such practices to be utilised in the future. Regarding the three UX ethics presented in Peta Goldberg’s “Ethics of UX Practice” lecture, the website provides a range of services that are aligned with the company's values, such as affordable internet services and customer support. However, it's important to recognize that not all users may agree with the company's values. In terms of benevolent intent, Afrihost's website appears to prioritise users' needs above all else, offering a range of services and support to ensure that users have a positive experience on the website. However, as previously noted, there is always the risk that persuasive design techniques may be used to nudge users in a particular direction. While there is no evidence of ill or misdirected intent on Afrihost's website, it's essential to recognize that designers must be aware of competing needs, such as business needs, regulations, and ecosystems. While it's important to meet these needs, designers must also ensure that users are not exploited or harmed in the process as  Vistisen and Jensen (2017) argue that "designers should always consider the potential ethical implications of their design decisions."
                </p>

                <p id="conclusion">Afrihost's website appears to be ethically sound, prioritising users' needs and offering a range of affordable services and support. The website also provides a well designed user friendly experience providing users with enough information that they need at a time without overloading them with complex information. The company's website is well designed with a simple layout that makes it easy for customers to access and manage their services.The website's design adheres to the basic principles of user interface design, with an emphasis on readability and legibility, visual weight, balance, and hierarchy. Afrihost's website is intuitive and user friendly, offering an easy experience for customers to manage their internet-related services.
