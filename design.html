                    <h3>Goal Alignment</h3>
                    <h4>My Goal</h4>
                    <p>I want my website to impress users with its clean, elegant design and effectively communicate my skills as a web designer. I want users to be inspired by my work and motivated to contact me for design services or exploring more of my portfolio.</p>
                    <h4>My User</h4>
                    <p>I aim to captivate individuals in technical and creative design industries, with the goal of positioning myself as an ideal partner for collaborative projects. My website will serve as a visual showcase of my web design skills and portfolio, designed to spark inspiration and establish credibility with my users. By presenting my work in an engaging way I seek to attract like minded individuals and encourage them to contact me in order to start beneficial partnerships.</p>
                    <h4>Content</h4>
                    <p>I aim to showcase my skills and expertise through a combination of sleek visuals, well written explanations and interactive elements that make my work stand out. By presenting my portfolio and design process in a clear and compelling way I hope to attract the interest of my users, while also maintaining a clear focus on my interests and passions as a web designer.</p>

                    <h3>Information Structure</h3>
                    <p> Every page in my website contains a navigation bar at the top of the page to allow the user to move between pages easily. My home page contains a short introduction to who I am and the kind of website this is. <br><br>
                        My blog page contains all my blogs in a blog selection aligned to the centre left to make space for an additional navigation bar on the right to allow the users to quickly move to a specific blog on the page. This navigation bar also follows the user as they scroll down the page so that they can quickly access it again so that they do not need to scroll to the top of the page again. <br><br>
                        My Design page consists of a section in the centre left of the page to represent a document that the user can read to learn more about the design choices of my website. The design page also consists of an additional navbar on the right side of the screen similar to the one on the blog page to assist the user in finding a specific part of the design document. <br><br>
                        My profile page displays an image of myself on the left side of the page with additional information listed below so that users can quickly see information about me like what I do, my interests and skills. On the right side of the screen my name is displayed as well as a description of who I am as well as a link to my portfolio page. <br><br>
                        My portfolio page works similarly to the design page as my portfolio is displayed on the centre left with an additional navigation bar on the right to jump to specific parts of my portfolio. The portfolio features three different games I created this semester in Game Design as well as their respective design documents. I made my portfolio page separate from my profile page as I did not want to overwhelm the user with information. I also made the portfolio accessible from my profile page so that the user is aware that they are viewing my portfolio.  <br><br>
                        My essay page also works similarly to the design page in order to keep a consistent design throughout my website with the essay being displayed on the centre left with a navigation bar on the right used to jump between sections of my essay. <br> <br>

                    <p> The user will be first presented with the home page, from there users can use the navigation bar at the top to move to other pages on the site. Additionally if the user clicks on the “Hello, I am Nicholas Isherwood” text they will be redirected to my profile page. If the user makes use of the navigation bar to move to the blog page or design page they will be presented with similar pages. On the blog, design, essay or portfolio pages the user can scroll down to read more information or they can make use of the horizontal navigation bar on the right side of the page to jump to a specific section of the page. On the profile page the user can scroll down to read more information as well as use the “Click here to view my portfolio” button to move to the portfolio page. </p>

                    <h3>Style Process</h3>
                    <h4>Visual Aesthetic</h4>
                    <p>For my website I seek to implement a minimalist and sleek aesthetic which is characterised by a clean and uncluttered design that emphasises simplicity and functionality. It relies on the use of simple and elegant elements such as clean lines, neutral colours, and a limited colour palette to create a sense of visual harmony and balance. The overall design is purposefully understated with a focus on the essentials and the removal of any unnecessary elements. This creates a sense of spaciousness and clarity, making it easy for users to navigate and understand the content on the website. One of the key elements of my aesthetic is the use of white space. This provides a visual break between different sections of the website which creates a sense of openness and allows my content to stand out. Additionally, through the utilisation of sleek animations on each page, sections of the website will smoothly slide into view when a user enters a page on the website. My goal with the minimalist and sleek aesthetic is to create a sense of simplicity and elegance that prioritises function over form. It is an effective way to create a clean, streamlined, and professional-looking website that is both visually appealing and user-friendly.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Font</h4>
                    <p>For the font of my website I used ‘Merriweather’ which I feel is a great fit for my minimalistic aesthetic. It has a classic yet simultaneously modern feel to it which provides simplicity and readability.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                <h3>Readability and Legibility</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Readability</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>My website's use of a legible font like Merriweather and consistent font sizes throughout the site helps to establish good readability. The central alignment of text in some sections, like the home page introduction, can also contribute to good readability by creating a clear visual hierarchy. Effective use of white space and paragraph spacing helps to make the text on my website easier to read by providing visual breaks and making the content less cluttered</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><b>Legibility</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>My website's use of a Merriweather font for headers, links and body text helps to establish good legibility by providing a visual contrast between different types of text. The black text against a white or grey background also helps to improve legibility by creating a high contrast, making it easier for users to read the text on my website. The horizontal navigation bar that follows the user as they scroll down the blog page also helps to improve legibility by providing easy access to different sections of the site, reducing the need for users to scroll back up to the top of the page.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                <h3>Colours</h3>
                    <p>I made use of a simple and limited palette for my website that I believe fits well into the minimalist aesthetic I am going for.</p>

                    <div class="greycolourbox"></div>
                    <p id="colourText">#ced4de</p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="whitecolourbox"></div>
                    <p id="colourText">#edf4ff</p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="blackcolourbox"></div>
                    <p id="colourText">#000</p>
                    <br>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Colour Theory and Relationships</h3>
                    <p>I believe my use of a limited colour palette of white, grey, and black is an effective approach to my minimalist design aesthetic as it helps to create a clean, professional and uncluttered look. Through the use of neutral tones the focus is placed on the content and layout of the website rather than on bright colours or patterns. This creates a sense of simplicity and elegance which is in line with the minimalistic aesthetic. The use of a limited colour palette also helps to create a cohesive and consistent visual experience for the user. By using a limited colour palette of white, grey, and black, I feel I can effectively communicate the minimalistic aesthetic of my website while also creating a clean and visually appealing design.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Composition</h3>
                    <p>My website contains a navigation bar at the top of the screen for every page to allow users to quickly access its other pages. Underneath the navigation bar is the content of the specific page the user is on. The navigation bar remains visible to the user at all times whilst browsing through my website. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Home Page</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The homepage contains much white space to keep inline with my website's clean and elegant aesthetic. </li>
                                <li>In terms of layout the page is divided into two distinct sections of text which introduce the user to the page. The first section is aligned to the upper centre left while the second is aligned to the lower centre right. This arrangement creates a sense of balance and organisation as the user's eye is drawn from left to right when reading.  </li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><b>Blog Page</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>My blog page contains a list of all my blogs that can be viewed by scrolling down the page. The blogs are aligned to the centre left of the page to make space for the horizontal navigation bar on the right side of the page. This allows the user to freely and easily browse through the different blog posts. The navigation bar follows the user as they scroll down the page allowing the user to quickly access it. </li>
                                <li>My blog page also features a sorting button located on the left of the first blog on the page. This button allows users to sort the blogs in ascending or descending order. </li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><b>Design Page</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>My design page works similarly to my blog page as the “design document” is aligned to the centre left of the page with a similar horizontal navigation bar on the right side of the page.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><b>Profile Page</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>My profile features two distinct sections on the left and right side of the page separated by white space. The section on the left side of the page contains an image of myself along with additional information about myself listed below separated by lines. This layout allows users to quickly see important information about me without having to read my description. By placing this section on the left side of the page it creates a sense of balance and organisation while also drawing the users attention towards important information. On the right side of the screen my name is displayed along with a description of myself. The layout allows the user to easily identify me and provides a clear overview of who I am. Underneath this section is a link to my portfolio page which encourages users who are interested in my work to explore it in more detail.</li> 
                            </ul>
                        <li><b>Portfolio Page</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>My portfolio page is laid out similar to my blog and design pages where the portfolio is displayed on the centre left of the page with a similar navigation bar on the right side of the page to the navigation bar found in the blog and design pages. My portfolio is split into four sections which includes an introduction and three of my games created in Game Design this semester along with a short description for each game as well as their respective design documents. </li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Hierarchy, Balance, Harmony</h3>
                    <p>The hierarchy, balance and harmony of my website is established through:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The use of visual cues such as the size and boldness of text as well as their placement to guide the users attention towards the more important aspects of my pages. For example the larger header text combined with the central alignment of it and the introductory text creates a clear visual hierarchy.</li>
                        <li>The use of white space which creates a sense of visual stability. The layout of my pages being always split into two distinct sections also creates a sense of balance as these sections take up equal or proportional space based on the size and importance of the sections.</li>
                        <li>The consistent use of design elements such as my pages’ typography, colour palette and layout my website achieves harmony. The use of a limited colour palette and consistent typography across all pages creates a sense of visual unity.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Style and Aesthetic Goal</h3>
                    <p>My goal is to create a minimalist and sleek website through my design choices in order to bring a visually pleasing and user friendly experience to my users that highlights the most important content and information of my website.</p>

                    <h3>My Selected Visual Design Elements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Minimalistic Aesthetic</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I have chosen a minimalist aesthetic for my website as I want to create a clean and simple look that focuses on the content and information. In order to achieve this I have intentionally limited the number of visual elements on each page so that users are not distracted by unnecessary design elements or clutter.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><b>Limited Colour Palette</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I have selected a limited colour palette of white, grey, and black for my website because I believe that these colours create a sense of consistency and balance across the site while also keeping the website clean and professional. White is the primary background colour, which helps to make the content stand out, while grey and black are used sparingly for text, borders and the navigation bar.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><b>Clear Typography</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I have chosen a typography layout that is easy to read and consistent across the whole website with minor deviations between pages. I want to establish a sense of hierarchy and make the content more accessible to users. I have selected a font that is legible at different sizes and weights, and I have also made sure that the spacing between lines and paragraphs is consistent throughout the site.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><b>Use of White Space</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I have used white space effectively to create a sense of balance and harmony across the site. I have intentionally left some areas of the site empty, so that the content is not cramped or cluttered. This helps to create a sense of visual breathing room and allows the most important content to stand out.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>I have used slightly off centre alignment in some sections of the site, such as the introduction on the home page and the alignment of blog posts on the blog page to create a sense of balance and harmony. This helps to create a sense of order and consistency across the site and it also makes the content more visually appealing and easier to read.</li>

                <h2 id="implementation">Implementation Notes</h2>

                <h3>Smooth Scrolling</h3>
                <p>I implemented a JavaScript smooth scroll function to work with the side navigation bar. This allows for a more visually pleasing transition when a user selects a section from the side navigation. Instead of abruptly jumping to the chosen section, the page now smoothly scrolls down, seamlessly guiding the user's focus. By eliminating the sudden shifts and providing a fluid movement, the smooth scroller function enhances the overall aesthetics and usability of the website. This improvement contributes to a more polished and professional feel, making the user's interaction with the page more enjoyable.</p>
                <h3>Blog Sorter</h3>
                <p>On my blog page I implemented a convenient sorting button which makes use of JavaScript for its functionality. The button is positioned to the left of the initial blog entry and is displayed as a grey arrow. This feature allows users to effortlessly arrange the blogs according to their preferred order. By clicking the sorting button, users can switch between ascending and descending order. The sorting button serves as a user-friendly tool, enhancing the browsing experience and allowing readers to navigate through the blog content in a manner that suits their preferences.</p>
                <h3>Portfolio Games</h3>
                <p>In my portfolio I showcase three games that I personally developed using during this semester. Employing a combination of Unity's webGL build feature, CSS, and JavaScript, I successfully integrated all three games into my portfolio, rendering them fully playable. I feel a sense of accomplishment with this as I faced many challenges and setbacks however I managed to overcome these. By incorporating these games, I have showcased my practical skills and creativity as a game developer in a creative and playful way, strengthening my portfolio's appeal.</p>
